# Changelog

Notable changes to Makerspace Core are documented here. Releases follow Semantic Versioning.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Assurance-aware password, PIN, and OpenID Connect authentication, account recovery, email verification, invitations, and session reauthentication.
- Managed-device identities and device-scoped permission grants.
- SCIM 2.0 provisioning and reconciliation, OIDC provider administration, and controlled visitor enrollment.
- Private profile images, Local/S3 file storage, versioned Lab Rules, and confirmation workflows.
- Open Day lifecycle management, calendar scheduling, recurrence previews, academic breaks, self-registration, assignment management, and supervisor staffing views.
- Machine logbook catalogs, jobs and ingestion, pricing snapshots, billing, inventory ledger, and operational statistics.
- Expanded People and Account administration plus a redesigned Role permission matrix.
- A permission-gated Activity log with current safe display labels, actor filtering, cursor pagination, and privacy-preserving fallbacks.

### Changed

- Audit events now retain durable user, system, or historical-unknown actor types and expose only allowlisted current labels without storing name snapshots.
- Access logs now correlate authenticated Account IDs and authentication methods, share trusted-proxy client addresses with authentication throttling, omit unmatched raw paths, and quiet successful health probes.
- The OpenAPI contract, generated clients, authorization model, deployment documentation, production Compose bundle, and CI validation were expanded for the new modules.
- Frontend tests use bounded concurrency and realistic UI interaction timeouts for stable execution on CI runners.

### Fixed

- Open Day scheduling now rejects ambiguous or nonexistent local times, validates slot bounds, and preserves assignment labels safely.
- Visitor enrollment pins the applicable immutable Lab Rules version throughout the workflow.
- OIDC linking requires recent proof, SCIM reconciliation preserves provisional identities, and anonymous recovery remains enumeration-safe.

### Security and privacy

- Mutations and audit records remain transactional, deleted users and resources do not leave retained display-name snapshots, and sensitive credentials, request bodies, headers, and arbitrary path values remain excluded from logs.
- Role delegation, assurance requirements, device scopes, last-master protection, and sensitive Person-field permissions are enforced server-side.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-18

- Introduced managed devices and scoped permissions alongside the initial People, Account, Role, Open Day, and audit foundations.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-09-14

- Initial development release.
